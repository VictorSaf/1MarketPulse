## 🔧 Installation Methods

### Method 1: Manual File Manager (EASIEST!)

Since bash commands are restricted, use the Figma file panel:

1. **Open the file tree** on the left side
2. Navigate to: `/tmp/sandbox/tmp/sandbox/src/app/components/`
3. **Drag and drop** each `.tsx` file to `/src/app/components/`
4. Or **copy/paste** file contents one by one

### Method 2: Download and Re-upload

1. **Download the entire project** from Figma
2. **Locally**, run this command in terminal:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/downloaded/project
   cp tmp/sandbox/src/app/components/*.tsx src/app/components/
   ```
3. **Upload/push** back to GitHub

### Method 3: GitHub Direct Upload

1. Clone your repo locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VictorSaf/1MarketFeed
   cd 1MarketFeed
   ```

2. I'll provide you the content of each component file (see below)

3. Create each file manually in `src/app/components/`

4. Push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "✨ Added all priority features"
   git push origin main
   ```

## 📋 Component File Contents
